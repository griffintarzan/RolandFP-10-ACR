## **Motivations**
As a piano hobbyist and developer, I wanted to extend the capabilities of my Roland FP-10-ACR digital piano beyond its default features. While the piano provides some generic features through its panel, it was limiting. I saw an opportunity to enhance its usability by adding features like MIDI playback, access to hidden tones, and a user-friendly control interface.

## **Features**
- **Tone Control:** Switch between 36 different tones, including 21 newly discovered tones.
- **MIDI Playback:** Play external MIDI files directly on the piano through BLE.
- **Recording & Playback:** Record and playback performances directly on the piano.
- **LCD Display & Button Interface:** hardware interface using an LCD display and physical buttons to control and interact with the system.
